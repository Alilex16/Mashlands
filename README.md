For information about using the template, see the Modding Wiki

---------------------------------------------------------------

Complete modpack for Stacklands, has been tested for functionality only (with DLC's).

Expansion of the main game. It includes new resources, equipment, structures, locations, an animal that loves pets, a library, a new strong enemy, a wandering trader who also trades in rumors and more!

Still to do:
-Figure out how the translation stuff works
-Need compiling?
-Release on workshop
